1. In this task, I connect to the server using socket.io library.
2. I have changed the data that the server sends to the client. Now instead of random numbers in the graphs 'change' and 'change__percent' the result is calculated.
3. Thanks to this, I made a visual color change when the price changes (rises or falls).
4. I also added a watch list where you can remove the stock or add.
5. Added the ability to change the interval of data transmission from the server
